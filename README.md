# magic-veneer

Token based interaction with a translucent veneer countertop. This prototype was created to test the feasibility of a tangible interaction on translucent wood veneer. It utilizes proximity sensors to trigger the different parts of the interaction. The enhancement of the tangible token is done through projecting a processing sketch on the translucent veneer.

## Warning

Processing code should be rewritten if prototype is to be looked at further. As-is it just is a PoC.
